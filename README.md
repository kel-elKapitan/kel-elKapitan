- 👋 Hi, I’m @kel-elKapitan
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Data Science, Analytics, Machine Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning streamlit (to create dashboards), YAML(git Actions & MS Azure) and Markdown(It is used EVERYWHERE) and snowflake(because my computer cant handle the data I want to work with)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will showcase the many skills I possess in the Data Science arena (Simple Algorithms, model selection, etc)
- 📫 You can reach me on.... Telegram ![alt text](https://github.com/kel-elkapitan/kel-elkapitan_telegram.jpg)
